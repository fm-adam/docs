# Java
## Starting a Java  Project

Create an IntelliJ project. Add the following jars to your project:

-   fm.liveswitch.jar
-   fm.liveswitch.opus.jar
-   fm.liveswitch.vpx.jar
-   fm.liveswitch.yuv.jar

These provide you with the minimum set of Opus/VPX capabilities. You can add _fm.liveswitch.openh264_ as well, if you want to enable H264 support. You will also need a library to capture audio and video data from the user. To do so include:

-   fm.liveswitch.java.jar
-   fm.liveswitch.java.sarxos.jar
