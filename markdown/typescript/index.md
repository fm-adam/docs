## Starting a JavaScript  Project

If you are starting a JavaScript project, create a new project in the IDE of your choice, whether that's WebStorm or Notepad. There are no optional dependencies to include with JavaScript, as all hardware and media codec functionality is provided by the browser. Using a **<script>** tag, include the core SDK files:
-   fm.liveswitch.js
